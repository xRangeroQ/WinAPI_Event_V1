# WinAPI_Event_V1

## 📌 Purpose
This project demonstrates how to handle **Windows events** in a C++ application.  
It is designed as a learning resource for developers who want to understand how to capture and respond to system or user-generated events in a Windows environment.

---

## 🧐 What Does It Do?
- Shows how to **listen for Windows events** such as keyboard or system signals.
- Demonstrates how to **process and respond** to these events in real time.
- Provides a simple and minimal example for beginners learning about event-driven programming.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. The program initializes a Windows event listener.
2. It waits for specific events (e.g., key press, system signals).
3. When an event occurs, the program executes the corresponding handler.
4. The application continues running until an exit condition is met.
